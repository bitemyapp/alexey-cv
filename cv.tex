\section*{Achievements}

\begin{itemize}

\item Took ownership of the Guidance, Navigation and Control subsystem of a search and rescue UAV blimp systems engineering project. I designed the autopilot, based on a BeagleBone running Gentoo. It read from a 9-axis inertial measurement unit, commanded gimballed engines, sent telemetry, and was commanded by a ground control station.

\item Developed a rocket launch simulation in .NET with staging and orbit determination. Rockets could be specified by stringing together multiple stage structures, which contained details such as total mass, type of engine, fuel capacity and so on.

\item Using C and Simulink I developed an Arduino based autopilot. I created plug-ins for both X-Plane, a PC flight simulator, and Simulink, to communicate with the autopilot, going through an intermediate microcontroller to convert analog outputs to digital outputs, thus enabling a full hardware-in-the-loop simulation.

\item Wrote a 3D ray tracing engine using C\#. It was capable of reflections, refractions, anti-aliasing, and adsorption.

\item Working on a Linear Homotopy Type Theory based programming language/proof assistant with features drawn from Coq, Agda, Epigram, and Idris.
